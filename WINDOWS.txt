Rough preliminaries for compiling under Windows.

You need:

* bzip2recover, likely from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bzip2.htm
* msysgit, likely from https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list
* gitbash (included in the above)
* Go, likely from https://code.google.com/p/gomingw/downloads/list

Install Go and msysgit. Make sure to install gitbash.

Clone the repository with git.

Drop bzip2recover and bzip2.dll into the root bzwikipedia dir.

**bit here about Mmap until that's resolved**

From here mostly follow the common instructions and run ./StartWiki.sh in
gitbash.

On windows ln just copies, so when recompiling be sure to delete
bzwikipedia.exe in the root dir before restarting.
